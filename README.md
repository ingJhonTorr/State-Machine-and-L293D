# State-Machine-and-L293D
The project implements a motor control system using Arduino and three sensors. It reads sensor data and determines whether the motor should turn left, right, or not at all based on predefined conditions. It also includes LED indicators for left and right turns and an alarm sequence when a specific sensor sequence is detected.
